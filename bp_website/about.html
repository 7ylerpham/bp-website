                <p> 
                    I've been known to kiss and tell
                    Send girls to wishing wells
                    If you're my man, I want you to myself
                    I know I'll have enemies long as you're into me
                    But I don't care 'cause I got what I need
                    Oh, yeah, need to get with the program
                    Boy, I keep you close like slow dance
                    Hit you with that red, don't go there, no, no man
                    Met him, then get him, I make sure we stay
                    Got the venom to dead him if he want a snake
                    I mean, sneak, I mean, play hide and seek
                    Know that I'm gonna find you
                    Make sure you get left or you leave
                    [Pre-Chorus: Rosé, Jisoo]
                    I saw you
                    And knew what I was trying to do
                    I had to play it real, real smooth
                    And once I finally made my move
                </p>
                <p> [Chorus: Jennie, Lisa, Jisoo]
                    I went crazy over you (Ah, ah)
                    Over you, only you (Ah, ah)
                    I went crazy over you
                    Like e-e-e-e, e-e-e-e, e-e-e-e 
                </p>
                <p>
                    [Verse 2: Jennie, Lisa]
                    Feels wrong but it's right, right
                    Blacked out, no night light
                    Pinked out like fight night
                    Maxed out of my mind
                    And the price right
                    Might buy, might bite
                    Never the regular degular
                    Would clean my mess up
                    But I'd rather mess it up
                    Simple is so-so, I need that oh no
                    Don't you know I'm loco?
                </p>
                <p>
                    [Pre-Chorus: Jisoo, Rosé]
                    I saw you
                    And knew what I was trying to do
                    I had to play it real, real smooth

                    [Bridge: Jennie, Rosé]
                    Boy, by the time I'm done
                    I won't be the only one
                    Acting like you made me
                    You can't blame me
                    Swear once you get a taste
                    You gon' take my place
                    And you'll love me crazy
                </p>

                    [Outro: All, Lisa, Rosé]
                    Sound the alarms
                    I'ma be mad 'til you get me back in them arms
                    Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
